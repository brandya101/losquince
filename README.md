## Highlights

The App allows for a search of a city and a subject.

The submit button will make an api call to google maps to locate the top 7 locations in a close radius. 

It will put a list on the response business card side with a functional add and delete button. 

When pressing add it will move the item to the left hand side of the web. If you refresh the page it will give you last 5 last searches done and saved on database. 

Things to work on:

Understanding global scope. 
Getting rid of repetitive code (if we can use a for loop/for each better).
hard coding some items on the html page confuses the whole project.
